V K Dwivedi,Reviewed in India on 5 March 2021," I was looking for a good bag but my budget is under 1500 and most of the good quality bag has a price tag of more than 2000.
I watched an ad on Instagram of the official website of this bag and decided to buy it. The price was 1365 on website but later it changed to 1600.

These are some reviews after putting my 14 inch laptop, clothes and other accessories. I am a student & solo travel vlogger and always carry one bag so you can guess the Goods I put in this.

Pros-
1 This Bag is really worth for the price and also have enough space.(I got it for 1599/- but when I received it the price decreased to 1499/- and the price tag of this bag printed 1799/-).
2 It has many extra pockets.
3 Zip quality is really very nice and also have a zip lock in bottle pouch so no one can open your zip.
4 internal quality of material is very nice and premium but outer fabric feels like RS400 bag but its not cheap.
5 the material is water resistant and zips also water resistant. (Water resistant means the material can safe your bag in an sudden rain or if some water falls on it by mistake. In heavy rain, the moisture can enter into it).
6 It has a secret hidden pocket in laptop compartment that can't be visible easily, you have to enter your hand and find it.
7 Shoulder straps are foam based with airy layer and also has a chest strap with little lock system.
8 it also has a spectacle holder.
9 The reflector logo is very bright in low light (you can see the pictures)
10 Stitches are best and have a good support in middle pocket.

Cons-
1 I was feeling warmness in my back after 15 min of using.
2 sometimes the outer material is feels like average but it's quite good in this price range.
3 the zip in the middle of laptop compartment can give a pressure of its bump on the side of laptop body.
4 they should provide a rain cover.
5 the back area could be more good. (You can see the difference in the pictures of Urban Tribe and Nike that I have attached).
If I found any problems with this bag or any other cons, then I'll share with you all.

So these are my honest review. I would suggest you to buy this bag, this is best in this price range. You will not feel regret after buying it.
Its really value for money.

Editing this review after rough use of one year, i would say go for it. After a rough use of one year this bag is same as it was delivered.",Verified Purchase,5,Urban Tribe Accelerator 30L Laptop Backpack 
rosh,Reviewed in India on 26 January 2017,"Well I bought this bag by just seeing the features as described and visuals available in the pics. So let me break down my feedback.

Delivery: on time
Product quality: the bag is quite spacious and the material used is of excellent quality.However, the zip quality seems to be of an inferior quality. Please note that I haven't faced any issues till date on the zip and my POV is purely based on the initial look and feel of the zip.
Major area of concern: I got the bag with a price tag of 970 inr while its on Amazon for 1200. I have no idea why such dual pricing issues. Either Amazon or the seller should please correct this. ( i am not able to upload any pics here of the price tag)

Overall I would have given it 4 stars but the price tag has crushed its one star from my end ;)",Verified Purchase,3,Urban Tribe Accelerator 30L Laptop Backpack 
Savvy,Reviewed in India on 15 May 2018,"Pros:
Design, black outer and beige inner, extremely well padded. sturdy partitions and organizers. the form factor is well defined rather compared to other luxury brands that usually gets disfigured when the contents are less.

Good for 1 or 2 day official or personal trip where you can accommodate , laptop file and 2 set of dresses along with other necessary items.

cons: (will give 5 stars , if this bags sustains prolonged usage)
1.looks like water resistant but not water proof.
2.Doesn't have her mesh padding at the back .
3.every time, front pocket zippers need to be aligned properly in order to run it smooth, this is negligible due to the sturdy stitch underneath.
4. only the two sides of the back strap is stitched to the bag, not sure if this could sustain forceful pick up with load, but I need to observe with prolonged usage.

First impressions: Overall bang for the buck.Go for it.",Verified Purchase,4,Urban Tribe Accelerator 30L Laptop Backpack 
Shailesh S.,Reviewed in India on 8 January 2022,"It has compartments very well organized for daily use. Packs so many things without cluttering in a single area. Looks compact, quite sturdy.

Ramesh Kumar,Reviewed in India on 1 September 2021,"The backpack is really good. Having a better water resistant mechanism. Large spaces inside. You can have a lot of items in it in organised manner. 2 sides bottle holder. It is light weight as well.

It could have a rain cover.
Padding is not up to the mark, means not good enough to hold for hours for your shoulder.",Verified Purchase,4,Urban Tribe Accelerator 30L Laptop Backpack 
SS,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2021,"The zipper sliders are short and could've been of better quality. Need to see how long it works because front two zippers are really stiff. Lubrication might fix it but haven't tried it yet.
