Jai shah,Reviewed in India on 13 March 2023,"If you are looking for budget Earbuds, I would say this one is best in budget, I got this for 899 & i think this is best in this price range. there are some cons of this buds like you will not get best sound quality when you full the volume like full 100% sound will start annoying, Ear fitting is quite bad & everything is fine. Best thing about this buds are like it only 5 to 10 min fir 1.30hr backup, litterlly i tried this, & sounds great when uhh use it on 80% volume......overall i willl give 3.5 star & this is best in budget. Thank uhh....",Verified Purchase,4,Airdopes Atom

Nik,Reviewed in India on 24 March 2023,"Good base.
Fast connection.

Slightly bigger buds if you’re used to apple’s earphones.

No noise cancellation. No other earphones with (half in-ear) have noise cancellation because the design doesn’t allow it.

Using rubber tip earphones can cause ear damage in the long run. So these earphones are great for people who want comfortable hearing experience.",Verified Purchase,4,Airdopes Atom
