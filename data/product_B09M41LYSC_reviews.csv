Sreejani Ghosh,Reviewed in India on 8 February 2022,"After one month of use I'm pretty impressed with all the features this laptop offers. The only con I can think of is the poor SRGB rating which causes all the colors on screen to seem less saturated no matter how you adjust the settings. The colors also seem washed out or distorted when viewed from an angle. At this price range, given that it's not intended for any intensive photo editing or gaming purpose, it's not too big of an issue while working. Also after a month of use, the boot up speed is also slowing down. It used to start within seconds initially but now it takes a minutes or two. Also the battery life lasts around 3-4 hours like it promises. Everything else is fine.",Verified Purchase,4,Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 10th Gen Intel
Shubham yadav,Reviewed in India on 31 January 2022,"The laptop looks better in person than the images on Amazon, although it comes with a plastic body but will give you a metal look. It is slim and over all look is superb. It just takes 5 seconds to switch on thanks to the SSD. Web cam is decent enough for video calls it just does its job I won't say its great but again you are not going to use it for your instagram pictures. Talking about the speakers its not that great you will have to use headphones for media purpose. Touchpad is smooth but it feels a little flimsy to me but it does it's job perfectly.In short if you are looking for budget laptop for basic tasks such as browsing office work or entertainment you can go for it. I got it for 27K by exchanging my old HP laptop so for me it was a great deal.",Verified Purchase,5,Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 10th Gen Intel

Hiren,Reviewed in India on 5 January 2022,"Never purchase from Amazon. They always contain defrauding clause. MS Office is free just for one week where as they are saying it's for lifetime. In case of exchange, even though my old laptop works fine.. they rejected for minor reasons. Don't invest 40-50 k in online mode. You will find the same product offline at almost same price with 10 times better services.",,5,Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 10th Gen Intel

sumanyu s.,Reviewed in India on 25 April 2022,"**Don't buy HDD variant.

I have 4GB variant but still works fine, 8GB should work even better for simple tasks

Review after 2 months

Battery : Life 6 hours. Used at 9 level of brightness with Bluetooth earphones connected, browsing web watching youtube videos installing apps with external mouse and slight use of external hdd amd office. Battery maybe better in an 11th gen processor.

Speakers : are obviously not good but audible when in a silent room even with ceiling fan running, can watch casual and educational videos comfortably.

Screen : Viewing angles from top is okay, for right left at max 2 people can watch movies together, bottom viewing angle is not that good when using lapop while laying back you have to tilt the display, okay for price.

Trackpad: Not reliable, noticed miss clicks and lags although size and placement is fine and palm rejection while typing is fine too. Not a deal breaker.

Keyboard : is good, had trouble at first, key spacing was a little too much for me but people who are used to this kind of keyboard should be fine, could only reach 75wpm but my usual is 82wpm. checkout layout in the photo provided some keys like page up & down are not at their usual places.

Hinge: is sturdy and doesnt wobble at all, doesn't open with one hand but feels reliable.

SSD: performance is really good. Apps opening 5 stars.

Port : A type C port should have been there but speed on USB 3.0 port easily got 110mbps on external hdd. Speed on sd card slot read 30mbps write 20mbps which is average but does what it says.

Charging time : is long not very fast cable is long enough if you work at a table. charging port is on left side I am used to right side. 6 feet 4 inches cable Really compact charging brick.

Build : Top and front panel doesnt immediately feels plastic but bottom pannel does and even sometimes squeak but doesnt feel cheap or unreliable.

Upgradable: Ram max only 12GB which fine considering the processor. ssd also upgradable. Fair enough.

Linux : Yes, WiFi and Bluetooth works out of the box, need to disable secure boot. I tried ubuntu, arch linux, mx linux they all worked fine.",,4,Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 10th Gen Intel
