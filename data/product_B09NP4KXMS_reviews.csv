Puneeth,Reviewed in India on 25 January 2022,"First I had a problem with activating MS Office 2021. I called Lenovo support. They could not fix it and asked me to contact Microsoft support which I could never reach.

Second, after couple of days the microphone stopped working. That's when I requested for replacement. Since they are out of stock for this model, they are refunding the money.",Verified Purchase,3,Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11th Gen 
Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 20 January 2022,"Well, this could have been a great deal if the display was a touch better. No complaints otherwise. For the price you are getting a very good processor, memory and storage - 512SSD (Dell doesn't offer this with their i311. Toshiba does have it, but their processor is inferior). Overall, this is the best laptop you can get for the price, if you are not too picky on the display. The display is decent for most home use, but you can see the flaw for example when attending a Teams meeting with a high quality image displayed.",Verified Purchase,4,Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11th Gen

SHAKEEL AHMED,Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022,"Though Lenovo products r gud but on heavier side. This model busts the myth. Antiglare screen may seem to be of poor colors reproduction quality, but worth for your eye comfort.

HemantKumar S.,Reviewed in India on 2 April 2022,Been using for 10 days and it seems really good has 2-3 sec bootup time which I have not seen so far. The screen panel doesn't feel metallic it's material isn't that strong. Battery isn't working for the hours provided as per specs works max 5 hours.
