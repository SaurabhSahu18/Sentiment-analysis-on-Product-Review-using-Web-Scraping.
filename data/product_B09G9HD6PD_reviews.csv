BiFrozT,Reviewed in India on 6 February 2022,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.
I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!
I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.

iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.

I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.

Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.
I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.

You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.

Speakers are Great.

Battery life is better than my previous devices,
iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.
NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.

For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.

But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.
Truly worth it.",Verified Purchase,5,Iphone13

Daljeet,Reviewed in India on 6 November 2021,"Apple Marketing has done quite a good job month after month to keep people on their toes with their new launches where there is nothing great about this phone. I have been on Android for almost inception of phones and switching to iPhone is just a pain.

1. No guide or help to transfer your critical data(Move to iOS doesnt work at all with high amount of data transfer.
If you want to buy, go to brick and motor shop and get your data transfer then and there.
2. Over hyped phone, nothing great i have found in the phone. May be i will find it better.
3. Total stuck with ecosystem.
4. At 90K they don't provide charger and are selling the same as extra. Total cheap strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe.

Kindle Customer,Reviewed in India on 20 February 2022,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.

Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as

1. Display of date and time on status bar
2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.
3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.
4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.

Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.",Verified Purchase,3,Iphone13

JonyKiran,Reviewed in India on 8 February 2022,"This is my first IPhone

Phone looks and feels premium in hand, definitely you cannot compare with Chinese android phones.

Battery is sufficient for normal day to day use, if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours, I don’t play games so can’t comment.

Security, OS and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that, this is where iPhone stands out from other phones.

Volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from Chinese smart phones. Same Dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.

Didn’t explore much on apple eco system, how ever I understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.

Nothing comes for free here, in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user (less customisation and no side loaders)

In a good way, if you respect your privacy, security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iPhone.

New users are good to go for iPhone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers, you will get extra features that are missing in 12.

Now sometime back Amazon said they cant even give me a replacement also and its totally being handled by apple. So I have to go back into iplant care and get my screen replaced.

Anil Sharma,Reviewed in India on 20 March 2022,"tl;dr:
If you can spend more money and want a better camera go with Pro or ProMax
If you like the Apple EcoSystem you can get this else stick to Android

Pros :
1. Good Display / Brightness (Supports Dark mode and You can control White Tone which is nice). It has 60Hz refresh rate but you won't feel the difference imho
2. Good Battery Life (iPhone 13 Series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger) I use my MacBook's charger which charges the phone pretty quickly.
3. Best Privacy Control
4. Camera in Portrait Mode and Selfie Camera (LiveText Detection is a nice feature)
5. Fast Processor / RAM management is good
6. Great Resale value / Apple Support

Cons:

1. Screen size (6.1"" which is less in this price segment)
2. Optical Zoom in 13 is not great (If you want a camera phone go with Pro or Pro Max or Android alternative)
3. Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option
4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)
5. No Native Support for mkv and other video formats (you can download a third party though)
6. Native iOS Apps either require a subscription or are paid.

Om Prakash Sahu,Reviewed in India on 1 May 2022,"A fabulous phone with the perfect size.

A smartphone have mostly 5 major categories in which it shows up its real value.
Cameras, Processor, Battery, Display and durability.

Cameras - 4/5 These are one of the best if not the best camera in a mobile device till Now!(except zoom)

Processor - 10/5
it’s A15 Bionic (Name is enough)
Snapdragon will take 2 years to even come close this powerhouse beast.

Battery life - 5/5. On my usage my iPhone yielded 9 - 10 hrs screen on time.
(Remember it’s not the highest mah cell it’s super efficient)

Display - 3/5 absolutely a shameful and greedy act by Apple in terms of display department it’s 2022 and in this year even 10k phones provide 120hz display and here comes Apple saving the 120hz displays for the pro models only.
(Note it’s probably the smoothest and the best 60hz panel)

Durability - 5/5 can easily last 3 years without any problem and after that just change the battery and it’s good for 3 more years + the resell value of iPhone’s are also best.

There are other minor factors like the Apple ecosystem, the Build Quality, the service, the secured ui, and a lot lot more.

Even basic android mobiles will give this and this is not at all acceptable for an iPhone which is major con.

Noel,Reviewed in India on 13 May 2022,"Let's start with the negative feedback here on Amazon. Some people are really derogatory with their reviews with respect to the phone, Ignore it!
If you are interested in the iPhone then you know what you are getting into.
It has its share of cons, one being that Whatsapp chat transfer from Android to iOS is not available at the moment, partly blame meta for the way they handle our data.
Keeping that aside, you're paying for a phone that will last you more years if taken care of well, the camera may not be the best in the market but does amazingly good across all modes, be it portrait or night mode or videos, btw the cinematic mode is Kickass!!
You are paying for security, the Ecosystem is really an underrated feature, the hardware is directly tied with how the OS works and the A15 is a powerful chip. The phone lasts a day.
Yes, there is no charger in the box and I wish the connector was type-c.
Hopefully, this helps. Will update the review with pictures soon.",Verified Purchase,4,Iphone13
V,Reviewed in India on 12 April 2022,"Switched over from Android because of how much time got wasted on it, both in choosing which phone to buy and after buying a phone. And now, things work when I want. It might not be 100% personalised, but it gets the job done. But, some basic features like a good telephoto camera and hassle free sharing are missing because that's how Apple became the richest company: forcing it's customers to buy more of it's products.
Still, if you're a working professional who appreciates a phone that does everything that a phone should do, and does it well, you can buy one of these.",Verified Purchase,4,Iphone13

Abijith,Reviewed in India on 8 May 2022,"What are the main things that you want in a phone
1: Processor A15 bionic fastest chipset for a mobile phone till date
2: Display Super Retina display looks just awesome and the notch becomes almost invisible while you are viewing content with black background. Supports Uhd in prime video. Also supports Dolby vision.
3: Speakers supports Dolby atmos. It is loud and clear.
4: Battery the best battery ever in an iPhone it lasts easily for over a day of heavy usage with almost 7hrs of screen on time.
5: Cameras as usual top notch from apple but missing telephoto lens when you try to Zoom and take pictures.
6: Protection comes with ceramic shield at the front the strongest phone display till date.
It is the best value for money smartphone from apple. There are very few things missing like the telephoto lens for which you need to upgrade to 13 pro.

Jitesh khurana,Reviewed in India on 25 September 2021,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new models

Screen
The screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.

The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.

Battery
Battery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hours

That's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.

Camera
The regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.

The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.
You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",,5,Iphone13

pratyaksha pritam,Reviewed in India on 21 October 2021,"So I ordered this phone from apple’s official website. And have been using this for the past 1 week and trust me it has one of the best batteries you will find on any phone. I am a moderate user when it comes to cellphones i.e the basic Instagram Facebook WhatsApp YouTube and Netflix. This phone if charged fully lasts up to 24 hours if used moderately without any heavy gaming.

The reason I am writing this review is because of the useless comments of people that are rated high but can’t actually afford this phone.

Coming from one plus 6t this phone is a huge jump (I love my one plus… still using it as my work phone) but it is obviously a lot to adjust to since we are completely switching to a different OS seems like shifting to a different nation all together.

den,Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022,"Those who are saying, it's just iPhone 12 with design change, then you're wrong,
And most of them are upgrading to 13 will have older devices.

First thing you notice is the battery backup, it is amazing, at least 3hrs more sot than 12.
Main 12MP camera now has bigger sensor , fast auto focus and sensor shift stabilization,
If you compare side by side with 12, you can see that, in most of the night time, 13 just opens shutter for 1s where as 12 takes 3s, means photos will be sharper and will not suffer from motion blur.
UW is slightly better in night, even though it's the same sensor
Cinematic mode is very good in day time with peoples , but kept at 1080p at 30fps
Dolby Vision HDR recording bumps up from 4k 30fps to 4k 60fps
It is brighter outdoors
BDS support in GPS
Magsafe accessories now attach even stronger
and now base storage now comes with 128GB",,5,Iphone13
Akash lalwani,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2021,Was using 11 before this. Wanted to go for 13 pro. Wished 120 hertz pro motion display in my phone. But that costed way too much. Nevertheless this standard 13 model is not too behind. Almost same cameras. Amazing battery life and speakers. And build is similar to 12 offourse but functionality is better. Great changes from 12 especially in camera and battery. Perfect value smartphone in 72000₹ (128gb). IOS is IOS. Ecosystem is unmatched. Hence for me a perfect phone.,,5,Iphone13

Jv,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2021,"The biggest improvement I have noted is the battery life. It’s really good. Upgraded from my 7 plus after 4.6 years. Another thing I like is MagSafe charging. One of the main issue I face with my old phone was charging port failure due to dust accumulation. MagSafe charge helps from above said issue. Of course we have to pay for that extra. Even though am enjoying bigger battery ,the thickness increased a bit and it is bit annoying. My advice is it’s a highly paid model, so use it minimum 3 years.",,4,Iphone13

Gursimar,Reviewed in India on 17 May 2022,"I bought this last month, before this I was using K20 pro.
My experience has been good with iPhone 13 in the last month. Phone is compact and easy to use.
I have turned off few settings which I don't require to get the best battery life. So I'm getting around 10 hours easily on a single charge. I have never used more than 60-70% of battery in a day (without any gaming) with 6-7 hours of SOT.
I also purchased a 20w portronics charger and it charges my iPhone in 1 hour 45 mins from 0 to 100. Although I never let it go below 20% and never charge it to 100%.
Photos cover out great, I feel front camera could have been better though and I miss telephoto. I got it for 65k after bank offer, I think the best price of this phone is below 60k.",,5,Iphone13

Kaustav Kar,Reviewed in India on 3 October 2021,"Ignore the negative comments made by amateurs.

Reasons for upgrade :
1. Camera: Bigger camera aperture, OIS, cinematic mode. Low light pictures are outstanding as you can see the 2nd picture of the flower taken at night. Also some of the pictures during daylight for reference.
2. Battery: Apple has really done a good job in battery management. It's giving a good battery back up.
3. Processor: New A15 processor and better performance.
4. Software: This is the usual strong point of any iPhone with iOS.
5. Storage: Not to forget you’re now getting 128 gigs as base storage compared to 64 gigs last year on base model price.

Who should buy this phone:
1. If you're already using an iPhone 12 don't bother to upgrade. Wait for next year release.
2. Those who are using iPhone 10 or previous versions can surely feel much of a difference.
3. Price gap: Iphone 12 is 70,000 INR with no offers at present. Iphone 13 with 6000 discount on HDFC Cards makes the actual price around 74000. It makes no sense to save 4000 and buy an year old device iPhone 12 if you’re upgrading from iPhone 10 or previous versions.
4. iPhone 12 purchase will only make sense compared to iPhone 13 if it's price gets reduced to 55000.

Customer Expectations:
1. At least an always on display.
2. On display fingerprint scanner.
3. A 90hz refresh rate if not 120hz for iPhone 13 model. In India we are paying a lot for base models.",Verified Purchase,5,Iphone13

I can say camera is best in market (Vivo v70 pro+ is biggest competitor), Build quality is good with lots of new feature.
if you are iphone 12 user, I will not suggest to you. Because there is no much difference between 12 and 13.
But if you are purchasing new iphone or upgrading from 11 or below, then you can recommend this as best option.
Iphone competitor samsung is providing foldable phone but they are not worth to buy because foldable are attractive for the first time only, after that you will see the bend clearly.

Feedback : This is fully satisfied with cool features",Verified Purchase,5,Iphone13

However, it is too expensive for the price, which is mainly bcoz of the Apple brand. Also, Apple not providing charger for environment purposes, is fake and I do not agree to it. It is another way of selling accessories at extremely high and bizarre margins.",Verified Purchase,5,Iphone13

I wish the import tax are not so much ....if we get the same price as the US this will be very fair to all the customers...
But the difference of paying 30 to 40% is very hurtful to the pocket....
With all bank offers and exchange combined this gives us a glimpse of relief...but still it isn't fair to pay so much more than the actual cost",Verified Purchase,5,Iphone13

ARUNAVA GHOSH,Reviewed in India on 8 April 2022,"Strongly recommend DO NOT BUY any apple products either airpods, ipads, mac, iphone or even apple pencil or charger from Amazon! Because even after the ""7 days replacement"" note on the seller or the product page, Amazon not gonna provide you a straight simple easy-going replacement at your door step.
No matter what ever product you've received, duplicate or broken or even a empty box....
They gonna straight send you to the service centre & after that service centre will guide you further! Amazon call it ""apple products policy"" they never mention! & You have to visit the service centre & collect documentation & whatever needed in between the replacement policy days!
Remember service centre always tries to repair the product.
& Even after that you not gonna have a straight easy refund!!
When you finally have to visit the service centre for a return policy even if you get a duplicate or defective product, which not gonna happen from your home, then why to buy it from online & not from a retail store!?",,1,Iphone13
Sk najid hossain,Reviewed in India on 22 December 2021,"The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year’s iPhone 12.

The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it’s a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.",,4,Iphone13
bujji,Reviewed in India on 14 March 2022,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.

Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as

1. Display of date and time on status bar
2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.
3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.
4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.

Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.",,5,Iphone13
