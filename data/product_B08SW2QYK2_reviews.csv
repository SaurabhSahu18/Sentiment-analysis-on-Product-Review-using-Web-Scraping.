Richa Nevatia,Reviewed in India on 14 April 2022,"Eye catching but a tad uncomfortable.
Very well finished and there‚Äôs quality in detail. Very spacious with more than adequate pockets and holders. Feels luxe to touch. Could almost work as an overnighter. Waterproof definitely.
The only con is that the handle bites into the hand and the briefcase seems very heavy when carrying even though the bag itself is not heavy and even with just a 13‚Äù Mac and a notebook the bag seemed too heavy. The handles could be designed better to carry as well as distribute the weight.

Overall I love it. The yellow is what I chose and it makes a statement.!

Would like to know how to clean it though.. being a light colour the dust is making it dirty.",,5,"Mokobara The Briefcase 15.6"" Laptop"
