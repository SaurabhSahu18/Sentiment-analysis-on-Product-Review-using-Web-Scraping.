abhaydeep kumar jha,Reviewed in India on 5 March 2021,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",Verified Purchase,4,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
Akash,Reviewed in India on 4 March 2021,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.
Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 28 February 2021,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..
Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget.",Verified Purchase,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"

Aditya,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2021,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.

Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.

Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.

Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).

Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.

Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.

Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.

Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.

I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.

Update after 2 weeks:
After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked.",Verified Purchase,4,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
ANI,Reviewed in India on 4 March 2021,"It's too strange to see a brand new HP pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....

Abhik,Reviewed in India on 6 March 2021,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.
Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.

Some closing thoughts:
The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!",Verified Purchase,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"

Prad,Reviewed in India on 23 September 2021,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.

George Kurian Basil,Reviewed in India on 21 June 2021,"HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air.

Disadvantage
1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet
2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key
3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply
4. There are 2 USB & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a
5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB A

Traveller DB,Reviewed in India on 9 August 2021,"Update after one month usage - MS Office 2019 preinstalled edition became unlicensed version within 30 days and refused to activate. HP support shared their product sheet that stated that this laptop came only with a trial version of MS Office 2019. Now I am chasing seller Appario Retail to honour the commitment.

Bad experience after paying high price (around ₹67,000) for preinstalled genuine software.

Other wise product has sleek looks, superfast fingerprint scanner, very good display, very responsive touchpad, decent (but tinny) speakers, USB C and barrel plug charging options and under 10 second boot up (SSD drive).

Ranjit Nair,Reviewed in India on 1 October 2021,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).

One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue.",Verified Purchase,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 30 August 2021,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.

Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!

The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.

The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I’m still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP.

When I said to back the new product he asked me some money and said he ll manage at his end. I didn't pay him. Later on he agreed to take old product and in case if it gets rejected in the policy he ll take back new laptop. But nothing went wrong so he didn't call me back after.

2. Please see the images and video. In just 6 months of use I faced display flickering issue. Even though it was under warranty, I had to run to service center for repair. They tried to reinstall OS but it was of no use. Finally they had to change the entire display and to my surprise even that didn't solve the issue.

I am still facing the same flickering of display issue.

Common, your product quality sucks man , own it up. Your charger pin short circuited without any liquid spill or moisture.

The battery is same as any slim professional laptop, gives 4-5 hrs battery backup in normal use and definitely this number reduces when heavy tasks are performed.

Fingerprint accuracy 8.5/10.

Upgradability is the single ssd that you can swap for more storage and from two- 8gb ram one them is upgradable.

Rohit Dubey,Reviewed in India on 4 March 2021,"I bought this laptop from hp store. This is the best budget laptop having 16gb - 3200 RAM. We can also increase the capacity of SSD to 1TB.
One thing I didn't like is 250 nits brightness..mit should have been 300 nits.

- latest 11th gen processor
- 16gb RAM
- SSD storage
- Backlit keyboard
- Fingerprint
- Type C charging (but they don't provide type C Charger)
- Only 1.41 kg",,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
sinisterscorp,Reviewed in India on 9 June 2021,"The only notebook brand in the market offering the latest specs for under 90k. I bought the Core i5 + 512 GB SSD model in April 2021 for about 61k from a recognised HP showroom instead of Amazon. After one and a half months of usage, I can say it's one of the good ones.

Although the webcam this model has is the worst. It is not 720p HD, it's worse than a low-level VGA webcam. The video and photos are extremely grainy and tinted. I approached HP Care thinking there was an issue with this unit. Turns out it's a universal problem and they wouldn't change the unit because the hardware was fine.

Sound is pretty good, finish looks premium metal, but is plastic... hopefully durable. It's on the quiet side with respect to fans, which only make noise if you're processing something heavy like updating the BIOS or converting a rather heavy raw video file to MP4. The chiclet keyboard is good, not too creaky and the backlight feature has a dimmer setting too.

There's a handy-dandy fingerprint scanner, which is smooth and fast with tactile recognition. The display is reasonably good, but not so powerful outside. If you work outdoors a lot, you'd have to put it on full brightness. You probably won't get optimum results even then.

A little disappointed in HP Care and the declining webcam quality. Given this day and age, there is a need for at least standard quality webcams. However, considering the price and the specs, the notebook is still worth it.

Pros:
- Latest Core i5 processor
- 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel RAM
- Lightweight and smooth design
- Reasonably good display
- Backlit keyboard
- Decent battery life ( I got 5-6 hours of heavy use
on battery, but that might be different based on what applications you're using)
- Good audio
- Intel Iris Xe graphics are really good. You don't need an extra graphic card unless you're into hardcore video editing, 3D modelling or design or
heavy gaming.
- Expandable SSD storage
- Fingerprint reader

Cons:
- Terrible webcam quality
- Metallic finish, plastic build
- Screen hinges aren't the most flexible
- Number of ports - 2 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB Type C, 1 MicroSD reader slot (as opposed to a full or mini SD slot, which makes it a bit difficult for DSLR users)
- Only 512 GB of SSD storage
- Colour - only Natural Silver, surface prone to scratches.

Will update if I notice anything else. Hope this helps!",,4,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
Raj Shah,Reviewed in India on 21 June 2021,"No matter how promising HP laptops look, their build quality is poor and have a track record of shipping faulty laptops and misfit chargers - speaking from experience with a top of the line 2L HP Envy laptop.

If the laptop is dead on arrival, they have a pretty lengthy process to get a certificate and their services, especially in Mumbai, India are pretty poor.

Save your hard earned money, if you want a reliable laptop, would highly recommend Asus.",,1,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
Prem,Reviewed in India on 12 September 2021,"So far its been 2 months and no problems! I tried to buy from Amazon but needed urgently due to my Alienware 17 Dell bought before 2 years not working.

I own so many laptops. This is the best so far. Very fast on airtel lowest plan. Performance is way better than my older Alienware. Alienware SSD is faster on paper but HP SSD performed better than Alienware on how it feels when I surf the internet.

So far never let me down once. Always works when I need it during working hours.

Best 16GB laptop. I see some negative reviews but maybe because of wrong hardware and not because of the computer.

Only cons are 14 inch screen and no ethernet slot but I already knew about 14 inch screen and ethernet slot you can get from USB to ethernet.

Amazing laptop. Can't believe I am writing review!!!!!!",,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
Ankit sharma,Reviewed in India on 10 March 2021,This could easily be the worse laptop at this price point as quality of the product isn't anywhere close to satisfactory....i don't knw if others have noticed it but the screen panel itself isn't installed properly into the panel housing....it could be misalignment or unsymmetric spacing between the left and right sides of the screen panel and top n bottom also.....even all the entry level laptops that i have come across have properly installed panels.....so please check carefully with the screen panel ...its not perfectly postioned......overall a really bad experience with HP ......,,1,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"

Excellent performance, classic graphics, sound quality- a real Dolby sound much exhilarating, backlit keyboard, good battery backup upto 7-8 hrs. Slim n light weight product with elegant look. The biggest thing is its startup and log off time which hardly takes 5 to 3 secs respectively.

Pros: Nice laptop ... highly commendable.
Cons: Not yet noticed after its 3 days purchase.",,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"
Fast Fish,Reviewed in India on 18 April 2021,"I dont want to talk about the specs and other technical stuff - since you can compare that and see for yourself.
Overall - its a great laptop with 16 gb ram and at this price point - its perfect for home business and personal use.

Probably cant use it for A grade gaming or heavy image editing or very heavy data processing / data science

Whats great:
1. Trackpad
2. Keyboard
3. Fast boot
4. Great look and feel
5. small and light

Whats not so great:
1. The screen cant swivel/fold beyond a few degrees
2. the cover is a dust magnet

Sidharth V.,Reviewed in India on 1 September 2021,"Got the HP pavilion 14 three weeks ago. Was really excited as I was using a HP probook 430 G2, which had 4gb DDR3 RAM, i5 3rd gen and around 1tb HDD. So I think you guys have a clear image of how excited I was when I got the Pavilion with 16gb DDR4 RAM, i5 11th gen and intel iris XE. Let me give you a clear image of my purpose of this laptop. I am buying this laptop solely for the purpose of college, so for downloading all the softwares required in the mechanical engineering field, softwares required for assignments(power point, office, word), softwares for communicating(whatsapp, telegram, mail) and entertainment platforms(netflix, prime, spotify) and other programs as potplayer, qbit and a bit of tweaking. The battery life on this ultrabook is really good( I can't really say the best even though I want to because I haven't really had the opportunity to explore the battery life of this laptop's direct competitors). It easily lasts upto 4.5-5 hours when I set the battery option to best performance). Its built quality dazzled me as it was really sturdy than it appeared. No loose hinges or anything. The screen stays where we set it, and no wobble while typing which shows the rubber grips are placed parallel to the surface. The display is bit less brighter than I anticipated, I would give it a 9/10. The typing experience is really good on this keyboard, however the color for the keyboard was a bit of a bad choice. I am a OCD type of person, So I get a bit irritated when I find smudges on the trackpad, keyboard, or on the inner surface of the laptop, but I doubt you guys will even notice it. The sound quality is really good on the laptop. This weighs around 1.4 kg so this laptop is easily portable, without compromising on performance, battery life and display (atleast for me).",,5,"HP Pavilion 14,11th Gen Intel Core i5"

When called amazon help they told me to upload pics of the screen which were not easily captured. So post the uploads of photographs and follow-up they informed me that they will provide me an replacement. I go the replacement but with following discrepancies:
The Warranty paper has some other serial number. so its is void. Secondly after activating the MS office its got locked after 15 days with a screen message saying the same being used on another laptop.
Called Amazon help they informed me to get help from HP and if they don't respond or deny the same, I should get a service denial communication from them. So Amazon will respond only after that.

Atul,Reviewed in India on 2 April 2022," I got the DV1001TU model. Product description claims to be anti-glare screen but in fact, it is so highly reflective like a mirror, that I can comb my hairs using it; very uncomfortable to work on. Touchscreen laptops usually have reflective screens (like the one on the right in the video that I've uploaded), but this is not even touchscreen. Simply unacceptable screen quality. The product is not returnable; it's replacement only and Amazon makes it a walk through hell, to return this on account of false description.

Connecting second monitor over USB-C DP does not work; second display as well as the laptop display starts losing signal. Driver update makes not difference.
