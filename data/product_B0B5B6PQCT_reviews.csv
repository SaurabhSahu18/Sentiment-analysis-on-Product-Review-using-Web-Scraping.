AV,Reviewed in India on 23 September 2022,"[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.

Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.
[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.

Good:
- Screen quality
- Battery life
- Looks and the metallic frame
- Call clarity
- BT calling at the price
- Reasonably accurate sensors

Bad:
- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.
- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.
- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.
- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.

Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.

You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.

boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.",Verified Purchase,4,boat
Vijayakumar N G,Reviewed in India on 4 April 2023,"Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product",Verified Purchase,4,boat
Gouri Shankar,Reviewed in India on 25 March 2023,"Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.
A honest review from a boathead",Verified Purchase,4,boat
